Welcome to the Help Section for the Route page!

The Route page is used instead of the map page to take the tour.

Starting at stop 1, head to Student Services where our tour starts, and spoiler, ends. Click on each stop as you continue the tour, or alternatively, click on the next button in the top right once you have already clicked on stop 1 to go to the next stop.

On each stop page, please click on the play button in the top right-hand corner and follow along with the text on the page. Pressing the pause button will pause the audio. Once you are finished you can click the back button to return to the previous page or click the next button to continue with the tour.
