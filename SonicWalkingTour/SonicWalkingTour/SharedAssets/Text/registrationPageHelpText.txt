Welcome to the Help Section for the Registration page!

To get started, if you have not registered before please consider registering by entering in your first name and email address. The email address is used by our registration office in case they need to reach out to you regarding any questions you have about the tour, or about our beautiful campus. 

If you do not wish to register that is fine! Please just click on the Continue button to get started.

Once either the Register or Continue button is clicked, click on the 3 horizontal line button in the top left-hand corner to get started.

Please note that this app does not collect any other personal information, or any other information from your phone.
